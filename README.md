# UTello
UTello (UT + Trello) + Unit Test
This program is an implementation of an interface class for easily managing and handling a project(like add people, add assignments, create a list of tasks, create tasks, move tasks from a list to another, assign tasks, delete tasks, etc.)

As its name suggests, It is somehow like what people do in Trello but tasks and users and lists are just names!

AlsoÂ  history is recorded of what lists added or was that successful or not, and....

I used inheritance for implementing in c++.

main.cpp is a sample of using UTrello interface. List.cpp, List.hpp, Task.cpp, Task.hpp, User.cpp, User.hpp, UTrellointerface.cpp, and UTrellointerface.hpp contain the code of Utrello class. makefile is for attaching all this files together. The sampleout.txt file is the recorded file of what happened in main.cpp.

This program was my assignment in the Advanced Programming course, University of Tehran, Fall2019.
