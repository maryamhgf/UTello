# UTrello
UTrello (UT + Trello) + Unit Test

As its name suggests, this project is an implementation of project management applications such as Trello. It is an object-oriented design in c++ and handles different tasks, users, and lists by providing several features such as adding people, adding assignments, creating a list of tasks, creating tasks, moving tasks from a list to another, assigning tasks, deleting tasks, etc. Also, the logs of the added lists or completed tasks are stored.

In the main file (main.cpp), you can find a sample of how to use the UTrello interface. The object oriented implementation of the classes List, Task, User, and UTrelloInterface can be found in the following files: List.cpp, List.hpp, Task.cpp, Task.hpp, User.cpp, User.hpp, UTrellointerface.cpp, and UTrellointerface.hpp. For building the entire project, a makefile is provided. Finally, the logs are stored in the sampleout.txt file.

This project is for my assignment in the Advanced Programming course, University of Tehran, Fall 2019.
